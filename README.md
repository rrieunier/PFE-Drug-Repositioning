# Enabling Computational Drug Repositioning using Knowledge Graphs
End of studies project conducted by Dr. Gayo DIALLO ([LaBRI](https://www.labri.fr/)) during the [ENSC](https://ensc.bordeaux-inp.fr/) / [ENSEIRB-MATMECA](https://enseirb-matmeca.bordeaux-inp.fr/) Artificial Intelligence course.

This repository provides a visualization tool to help biochemists to find new purposes for drugs based on their links in knowledge graphs.

**First of all, you should have a look to the respective READMEs of the backend and the frontend directories.**

To run the project, open 2 terminal sessions. In the first one:
```bash
cd backend
chmod +x server.sh
./server.sh
```

In the second one:
```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```
